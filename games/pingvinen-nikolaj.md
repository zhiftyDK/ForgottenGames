## About:

Pingvinen Nikolaj is an old Flash game commonly associated with Olines Ø. In the game, your goal is to cross a river to collect pancakes for Nikolaj. You accomplish this by jumping across floating logs and hippos to safely reach the other side.

The game is still playable in the browser thanks to web.archive.org. The game is hosted by ForgottenGames.
