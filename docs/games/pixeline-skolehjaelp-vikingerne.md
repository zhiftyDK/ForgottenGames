### Playability: 🟢

### Fixes and patches:

* [SafeDiscLoader2](/ForgottenGames/fixes-and-patches/safediscloader2dll.html) - Required to play the game

* [GDI Scaling Patch](/ForgottenGames/fixes-and-patches/gdiscalingpatch.html) - Fixes scaling, makes the game fullscreen

<hr>

### System Requirements:

The game doesnt scale properly (postage stamp effect) unless you use the GDI Scaling Patch. The game is only tested with these fixes on a x86 Windows machine.

```bash
Resolution = 1920x1080
Platform = x86
OS = Windows
```

<hr>

### Starting the game:

You can start the game from the start menu or by double-clicking the executable.

The CD/DVD/iso must be mounted for the game to play.

### Known limitations:

* Needs the CD/DVD/iso mounted
* The game only works in fullscreen with the GDI Scaling Patch
